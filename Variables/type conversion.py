#we will see how to convert various variables to different types

#float
GPA = 9.8

#string
name = '25'

#int
roll_number = 24

#float to int
print(int(GPA))

#int to float
print(float(roll_number))

#string to int not possible if the string doesn't have numbers only
#char to int not possible unlike C++, C where you get the ASCII value of the char
print(int(name))
