#A program to see what the ceil method under math class does

import math
flt = 8.1

#lets see what round does:
print(round(flt))
#Round rounds the  value to the nearest integer

#use the ceil method under math class
ceil_val =math.ceil(flt)

#ceil returns the value of the next highest integer to the given float value
print(ceil_val)
